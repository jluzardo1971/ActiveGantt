# ActiveGantt

Since the product has long been discontinued, I have made the ActiveGantt source code freely available under the MIT License.

ActiveGantt is a Gantt chart component that you can use to add advanced Gantt scheduling capabilities to your Windows Forms, ASP.NET, Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), Silverlight, Access, MFC (C++), and JavaScript/JQuery/HTML5 based applications in very little time. You can use it to visualize, persist and print your time based information. The ActiveGantt chart component now has the integrated option to import information from Microsoft Project 2003, 2007 and 2010 XML files. Use ActiveGantt to easily build rosters, TV/movie programming, classroom scheduling, payroll, equipment/location rental, employee management, assembly-line production, and many other applications.

An ActiveGantt control displays all types of data that can be presented in a Gantt schedule format (with time being incremented along the x-axis), and can be used to display tasks, appointments or other kinds of programmed activities for short or very long periods of time.

This Gantt chart component makes it easy to build rosters, TV/movie programming, classroom scheduling, payroll, equipment/location rental, employee management, assembly-line production, and many other applications.
